## Values

* **Continuous Improvement** - No matter how much or how little. I always try to learn new things. I can sometimes end up obsessing over them, but I still try to learn them. I also really appreciate when others are trying to learn and I do my best to help share everything I know with those who want to learn.
* **Honesty** - I always strive to be as honest as I can be and I very much appreciate when others are honest with me. This is especially true when I might be doing something wrong. Knowing that someone cares enough to stop me and say "I think you might be wrong here" is something I really value
* **Respect** - I love the act of showing and being shown respect. It really helps with my other two values. If someone is honest with me, I respect them more and if someone has earned my respect, I value their honesty more.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

What about when one of us wants to call you out in some way for something awesome you did, a
great piece of advice you gave, an insight you had, or your amazing Cat Thursday shirt—how do
you feel most comfortable receiving that recognition?

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? How do your energy levels fluctuate through-
out the day?

## Communication Preferences

How should people best get your attention for urgent matters, during and out of your working


hours? What's your relationship to work communication when not at work? What are your signs
that you'd prefer to not be interrupted when at work?

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

Any pet peeves we should know about? Knowing them may not, and shouldn't be expected to,
change others actions—but it might help us better understand and empathize with your reactions.
In fact, you might want the disclaimer above to stay in your document.

## Career Goals & Future Interests
