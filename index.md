## Values

* **Continuous Improvement** - No matter how much or how little. I always try to learn new things. I can sometimes end up obsessing over them, but I still try to learn them. I also really appreciate when others are trying to learn and I do my best to help share everything I know with those who want to learn.
* **Honesty** - I always strive to be as honest as I can be and I very much appreciate when others are honest with me. This is especially true when I might be doing something wrong. Knowing that someone cares enough to stop me and say "I think you might be wrong here" is something I really value
* **Respect** - I love the act of showing and being shown respect. It really helps with my other two values. If someone is honest with me, I respect them more and if someone has earned my respect, I value their honesty more. 
* **Loyalty** - I am a very loyal person, by nature, and I will always do my best to help those around me. I also appreciate loyalty in return.


## Personality

I tend to be a very curious and ambitious person. Usually, I don't settle for how things are because I know that they can always be better. This, of course, can sometimes by a double-edged sword. I can also become pretty obsessive about things and work hours and hours on something because I feel like I **need** to know the answer. 

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

I really love when I or my team receive recognition, and I am very proud when we do, but I may be a little different from most people when it comes to feedback. To me, it is more important to know about the negative/impactful things first, so that I can course correct. By nature, I assume that if there is no feedback or recognition, then things are going well.

## Work Patterns

I am remote and based out of KC, so I tend to be online earlier in the morning Pactific time. I tend to try and get mental breaks during the day so that I can stop thinking about things. This helps me prevent any obsessing over issues/concerns. 


## Communication Preferences

I definitely prefer Slack/chat or email over voice calls, since they allow me to answer when I am able to, but I completely understand that sometimes things are urgent and require a call. I do my best to be available for anyone who needs me, no matter what hour or day it is. If I am able to help, I will try.

## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

I believe that the main warning sign I have is that I will get defensive of myself and my team. I do, however, think I am good at noticing when I am starting to go to the dark side and making sure people are aware.

### How to help

Most of the time it's as simple as giving me a few minutes to recompose myself. On the worst of days, I will probably let everyone know that it's a bad day and that I need to get away from the computer for a bit, and giving me that time and space really help. 

## Me Being Me

Sometimes I start to ramble, end up doing down rabbit holes or going off on tangents and I certainly appreciate when people stop me and get me back on track.

## Pet Peeves

* **Finger-pointing** - I prefer to find a solution to a problem rather than try and point fingers or blame someone/something.
* **Stagnation** - I believe that things always need to keep moving. Even moving backwards is better than not moving at all.
* **Indifference** - If there is an issue, we should all care about it, especially in a professional setting.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

My goal is always to be as helpful to those around me as I can. I would like to continue to grow into upper management and into more senior roles over the coming years.

## Areas for Development

I just want to be the best version of me that I can be, so I would love to improve and develop in any way possible.

## Ask Me About

I am a pretty chatty person, but most of all I enjoy talking about sports, music, and tech.
